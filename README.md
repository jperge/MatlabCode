# MatlabCode
Hi Mark,

This is the Monkeywrench api, which takes care of opening individual experiments and visualizing neural data, or a batch of multiple experiments at a time. Typically, I write one short matlab script that extracts one type of neural/behavioral data, and use monkeywrench as a wrapper to run this script on selected experimental sessions.

The neural data is quite large. I will share one senssion with you on Dropbox. Let me know if this worked!

J.
